# TO-DO-LIST

The Dynamic To-Do List App is a simple yet powerful productivity tool built with the synergy of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This web application helps users organize their tasks, manage their time efficiently, and stay on top of their responsibilities.

# Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The app boasts an intuitive and clean user interface designed to enhance the user experience. 

Task Creation and Deletion: Users can easily add tasks by typing them into the input field and pressing the "Add" button. Additionally, tasks can be removed with a simple click on the delete icon, promoting swift task management.

Dynamic Task List: As tasks are added, the list dynamically updates to display the newly added tasks. Each task is accompanied by a checkbox that users can toggle to mark tasks as completed.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. Users can access and manage their tasks from desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Local Storage: To ensure that tasks are not lost even if the user closes or refreshes the browser, the app employs local storage. This feature allows tasks to be saved and retrieved for future sessions.

# How It Works:

Task Addition: Users enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button. The task is then appended to the task list with an accompanying checkbox.

Task Completion: Users can mark a task as completed by clicking on its checkbox. A visual indicator, such as a strike-through or change in color, can be applied to signify completed tasks.

Task Deletion: To remove a task, users click on the delete icon next to the task. The task is instantly removed from the list.

Local Storage: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage as they are added or modified. When users revisit the app, their tasks are retrieved and displayed on the task list.

# Technologies Used:

HTML: The foundation of the app's structure and content presentation.
CSS: Responsible for styling and layout, enhancing the visual appeal of the app.
JavaScript: The driving force behind the dynamic features, task manipulation, and local storage integration.
